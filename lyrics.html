        I'd say, see you later, if I thought I'd see you later
        And I'd tell you, that I loved you, if I did
        It's so strange, deciding, how to feel about it
        It's such strange, emotion, standing there beside it
        
        I'm home, with moonlight on the river, saying my goodbyes
        I'm home, there's moonlight on the river, everybody dies
        
        I'd say, see you next time, if I thought there were a next time
        Easy conversation, ain't exactly where we're at
        It's so strange, deciding, how I feel about you
        It ain't like, I ain't used, to going on without you
        
        I'm home, with moonlight on the river, saying my goodbyes
        I'm home, there's moonlight on the river, everybody dies
        I'm home, with moonlight on the river, saying my goodbyes
        I'm home, there's moonlight on the river, everybody dies
